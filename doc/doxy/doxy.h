/**
@mainpage OpenEM: Open Source Electronic Monitoring Library

<b>OpenEM</b> is a library that provides advanced video analytics for 
fisheries electronic monitoring (EM) data.  It currently supports detection,
classification, counting and measurement of fish during landing or discard.  
This functionality is available via a deployment library with
pretrained models available in our example data (see tutorial).  The base
library is written in C++, with bindings available for both Python and C#.
Examples are included for all three languages.

The current release also includes a training library for the all OpenEM
functionality. The library is distributed as a native Windows library and
as a Docker image.
